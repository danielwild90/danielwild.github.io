            <P class="story1">
            Our story begins with 4 heroes, Hector the Well-Endowed, a Ranger, half-elf, Thalema the Forgotten, a human druid, 
            Tiny Nuggins, a dwarven cleric, and Nightman, a human warlock.</P>
            <p class="story1">
             Upon different circumstances per individual, our heroes approach the "haunted Mansion" and begin exploring the surrounding 
             area. Utilizing his keen sense of awareness, Hector guides the team towards the garden. Here he knows something is afoul.
             Immediately they confront 2 Giant Weasels (25xp ea). Hector slices the head off of the first, while Thalemas stabs the 
             second to death with 3 hard blows. After slaying the wild beasts, they approach the well where they 
             encounter 2 Poisonous Snakes(25xp ea). After Tiny cleanly slides his longsword through the first serpent’s thoat, Thalemas
             uses his animal handling to tame the second. Within the well the adventurers find 14 gold pieces. </p>

            <p class="story1"> 
             After defeating and/or taming all foes our heroes decided to enter the haunted mansion. 
             They entered the structure from a
             door nearest the well where they battled the snakes. Immediately upon entering our heroes were swarmed by spiders (100xp). 
             Here, Thalemas uses his druidic magic to burn the spiders to a crisp. Below the ash they find 5 gold pieces. 
             As our heroes carefully advance through the mansion they decided to enter the kitchen. Upon which, they were attacked by 4 
             Giant Centipedes (50xp). While the first latches onto Nightman, the second is sliced in half by Thalemas, the third is struck
             in the head by Hector’s arrow, and the fourth is beheaded by Tiny’s sword. Regardless of its mightless struggle, the first 
             centipede is stabbed to death by Nightman.</p>

             <p class="story1">
             After dispatching the slimy creatures our travelers climb to the second story 
             of the building where they encountered 6 Stirges (25xp) in the attic. While the Stirges do hurt our heroes, with their rapid
             and furious attacks, Nightman uses his knives and bravery to slash a majority of them to death. Those remaining suffered a 
             far less quick death after being subjected to Thalemas’ serpent’s vicious poison. As the remaining Stirges writhed in agony,
             the heroes rummaged and find 20 gold pieces. After exiting the attic, the travelers ventured into a spare room where they
             found a set of relatively new clothes, considering the distress of the remainder of all other items in the building.</p>
             
             <p class ="story1">
             Still confused by the good condition of the clothing, the party moved into their next room. Here they encountered 2 more 
             spider swarms (50xp), which are quickly devoured by our hungry serpent. Here we find 5 gold pieces. Moving to the next room 
             our heroes find a crumbling bedroom full of nothing except a weird lantern that appears to be used for a weird singnaling 
             system…</p>

        <p class="episode">Episode 2</p>
        <img src="images/signaling-lantern.jpg" class="signaling-lantern" width="650" height="400"/>
             <p class="story1">
             After finding the strange lantern used for signaling, our heroes also come across a man, bound and gagged. After releasing
             him, he identifies himself as Ned Snakeshaft; a prisoner of the villains in the haunted mansion. Ned promises to aid the 
             adventurers in their quest as he vowes to seek revenge. Thus, our heroes give him clothing and a weapon to aid them on their 
             mutually beneficial quests.</p>
             <p class="story1">
             With their new-found adventurer, the group moves down a flight of stairs. In the livingroom they find 2 gp, in the library
             they find 21 gp and in the study they find 2 potions of healing. As they enter the living area they hear an ominous voice 
             say "Welcome fools-welcome to your deaths!", ending with fiendish laughter. Immediately, they are attacked by 2 scouts (100xp)
             and 1 bandit (25xp). The scouts fire off their arrows. One misses, while the second strikes Tiny; albeit his armor deflects
             the blow. The bandit charges towards Nightman and strikes a blow to his right arm. Ned Snakeshaft draws his sword to 
             retaliate, but instead stabs Hector in the back. Hector, wounded by the blow, turns and slashes Ned across the neck, 
             Immediately killing the snake of a man. Meanwhile, Tiny thrusts his sword into the bandit who wounded Nightman. 
             Thelemas works a fireball with which he incinerates a scout. The remaining scout loads another arrow only to be stabbed in 
             both eyes by the injured Nightman with his dual daggers.</p>
            <p class="story1">
             After the betrayal and battle the gang searches the room and discovers a trap door. Upon descending they discover a cellar. 
             Inside they discover 50 gp worth of wine, plate mail, a longsword, a standard shield, and an explorers pack on a corpse. 
             While looting the dead body, the adventurers are swarmed by a cluster of rot grubs (100xp) which are quickly roasted by 
             Thalemas. Further exploration of the cellar brings our heroes face-to-face with 2 more bandits (25xp) and 1 scout (100xp).
             Hector’s intuition allows him to notice the villains  first and he then warns the others. At the same time he nocks and arrow
             and delivers a wounding blow to the scout. Simultaneously, Thalemas, Nightman, and Tiny charge the enemies. Using their
             advantage of surprise, Thalemas slices open the belly of the wounded scout and Tiny rips one bandit from belly to throat. 
             Meanwhile, Nightman attempts to thrust his daggers into the last bandit, but fails to succeed due to the bandits sudden 
             realization of his peril. The bandit then stabs at Nightman, who dodges the attack due to his keen dexterity. Finally, it is 
             Hector who lands his second arrow, ear to ear it exits the newly made corpse. Our heroes find 9 gp on these bodies.
            </p>
        <p class="episode">Episode 3</p>
            <p class="story1">
             After killing the enemies in the cellar our heroes discover notes on how to operate the signaling they discovered earlier.
             They then decide to move into a room that was barred from the outside. While rummaging around they find 30 gp. Then they 
             begin to hear a strange cracking sound similar to that over bones rubbing together. Tiny, with his darkvision, notices
             the movement of 6 skeletons(100xp). Our party, realizing they are out matches, retreat back to the cellar for defensive 
             positions.
             </p>
             <p class="story1">
             As they fall back, Hector and Nightman fire arrows to seemingly no avail. Tiny holds his ground, taking multiple blows, while
             Thalemas charges in with his scimitar. It is here that Thalemas is struck a near mortal blow. Tiny hoists Thalemas up and 
             falls behind Hector and Nightman who have now drawn sword and dagger. While Tiny uses Lay on Hands to heal Thalemas, Hector 
             is slashed by the skeltons. Having saved the druid, Tiny charges in to assist Nightman as the latter draws the near dead 
             Hector from battle. Nightman notices he can not defeat the 6 skeletons alone and cries to the team to retreat. Thalemas
             hastens for the room prior to the cellar and Tiny follows, Hector on his shoulder. Nightman comes to the room last and shuts
             the door.</p>
             <p class="story1">
             Inside the room, Tiny heals Hector using the same spell used on Thalemas, while Nightman and Hector hold the door. Upon
             healing the half-elf, Tiny takes charge of the door. As he does so, Nightman and Hector draw their bows, while Thalemas 
             prepares a fire spell. Once prepared, Tiny opens the door and crushes the first skeleton to pieces. Hector and Nightman
             fire their arrows to no avail on the meatless creatures and quickly draw their swords. Thalemas turns one skeleton to dust.
             The remaining 4 skeletons all hack at Tiny, but only one is able to penetrate his sturdy mail plated armor. With minor
             wounds, Tiny collapses yet another skeleton while Thalemas reduces another to ashes. The fifth skeleton is battered by
             Hector and Nightman as they jointly smash him with scimitar and daggers. The last remaining skeleton slashes at Hector, but 
             misses due to Hector's dodging. Quickly after, Tiny turns another skeleton into a pile of bones.
             </p>
             <p class="story1">
             Assuredly, after the battle with the skeletons our heroes would get some rest, but to their dismay they notice a glowing
             blue light illuminate from the room the skeletons came from. From that room and into the cellar floated The Skelton Alchemist
             (100xp). As he lobbed acid towards our heroes, Thalemas smote him with a significantly weak fireball. Puzzled by the weakness
             of the skeletons' "leader" the adventurers loot his ashes to find objects totaling in worth of 120 gp.
             </p>
             <p class="story1">
             After defeating the skeletons, our gang moves into a set of caverns. The single entry quickly gives to a right or left
             split. Hector and Tiny argue which way to proceed; right or left, respectively. Utilizing his charisma, Hector convinces
             the party to go right. After a bit of walking, Tiny, the forward, is struck by falling green slime. Nightman, following
             closely behing Tiny, is acrobatic enough to dodge the burning goo. As the slime burns Tiny, he curses Hector (in a way
             that a majority would not consider foul).
             </p>
             <p class="story1">
             After Tiny cleans his armor from the green slime, the party continues on. As they move through the caverns the come to an
             narrowing where they encounter 1 scout (100xp), 1 bandit (25xp), 1 Hobgoblin (100xp), and a man named Sanbalet (200xp). The 
             Hobgoblin and bandit take point and prevent the heroes from approaching the others. While taking a defensive stance, the
             bandit's skull is crushed by Tiny's longsword. The scout fires an arrow and strikes Hector in the shoulder. Sanbalet fires 
             a magic missile and shouts "why have you fools come to Sanbalet's lair". Upon hearing his voice, the heroes realize, it was
             Sanbalet who created the Magic Mouth spell to alert the other villains. While the magic missle misses, the Hobgoblin is yet
             able to slash into Tiny, despite his strong armor. Meanwhile, Hector misses his arrow shot due to him being hit and Thalemas
             strikes a fireball into the Hobgoblin to little effect. Then, Sanbalet fires another magic missile shouting "I AM SANBALET", 
             this time hitting Tiny to devastating effect. It is here that Nightman, in a daring attempt, uses his spell blur to
             distort images for the Hobgoblin and slip past him. With Tiny barely alive, Nightman moves past the Hobgoblin and is able 
             to insert to daggers in Sanbelet's belly and slice them out towards his sides. While confused by the blur spell, Hector
             is able to use his scimitar to slash the neck of the Hobgoblin. In a fit of near-death rage, the confused Hobgoblin slashes
             at Tiny, only to be forever silenced by a swift blade to his throat from Thalemas.
             </p>
             <p class="story1">
                While dying, Sanbalet asks the heroes "why have you done this to Sanbalet?" They responded by mocking his name and
                informing him that his "haunted-mansion" was a bane to the community. Upon hearing "haunted-mansion" Sanbalet informs the 
                group that he was merely smuggling, an act widely accepted in Saltmarsh. Before the adventurers can ask more questions,
                Sanbalet succumbs to his wounds.
             </p>
             <p class="story1">
                With questions about Sanbalet's claims of accepted smuggling still lingering in their minds', the party ventures down 
                the next section of the caverns, this time silently.
